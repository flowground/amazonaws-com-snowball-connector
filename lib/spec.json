The commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball and Snowball Edge devices. To transfer data locally with a device, you'll need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball.",
